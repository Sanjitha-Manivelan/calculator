I created a calculator that allows you to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
I made my project because I wanted to create a simple project and wanted to learn how to code in CSS more.
I made it using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
I struggled with making the numbers be clickable and I learned how to make a gradient background!
